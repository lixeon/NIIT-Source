/**
 * <code>TimeZone</code> represents a time zone offset, and also figures out daylight
 * savings.
 *
 * <p>
 * Typically, you get a <code>TimeZone</code> using <code>getDefault</code>
 * which creates a <code>TimeZone</code> based on the time zone where the program
 * is running. For example, for a program running in Japan, <code>getDefault</code>
 * creates a <code>TimeZone</code> object based on Japanese Standard Time.
 *
 * <p>
 * You can also get a <code>TimeZone</code> using <code>getTimeZone</code> along
 * with a time zone ID. For instance, the time zone ID for the Pacific
 * Standard Time zone is "PST". So, you can get a PST <code>TimeZone</code> object
 * with:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * TimeZone tz = TimeZone.getTimeZone("PST");
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p> This class is a pure subset of the java.util.TimeZone class in J2SE.
 * <p> The only time zone ID that is required to be supported is "GMT".
 * <p>
 * Apart from the methods and variables being subset, the semantics of the
 * getTimeZone() method may also be subset: custom IDs such as "GMT-8:00"
 * are not required to be supported.
