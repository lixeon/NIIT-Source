VMEXTRA DIRECTORY

This directory contains the source code of
various platform-independent, optional
components of the KVM that are potentially
useful for many KVM ports.

- JAR file reader and inflater (decompressor)

- Java-level debugging interface (the parts
  of the debugger that need to reside inside
  KVM when using the KDWP debugging interface.)

- Native implementation of a number of networking
  protocols.

- Implementation of a "fake static memory" system
  that allows a desktop computer to emulate a Palm-
  like memory architecture that does not provide
  direct access to all the memory locations.
